                Machu Pichu is a city in modern Peru located up in the Andes Mountains which is about 43 miles away from Cuzco. Machu Pichu is atop of a ridge with the ridge being between a block of highland and the Huaynac Picchu. Machu Pichu means "Manly Peak" and was most likely a royal estate and religious retreat. Machu Pichu was built within the time periods of 1460 and 1470 AD by Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, and Incan ruler. The city of Machu Pichu is built above the Urubamba River canyon at an altitude of about 8,000 feet. After the death of Pachacuti, the city of Machu Pichu became the property of his kinship group which was then responsible for its maintenance.

                Machu Pichu contains about 200 buildings. The buildings consist of temples, storage structures, other public buildings, and residences. It was known that about 1,200 people lived in and around Machu Pichu. Most of those 1,200 people were women, children, and priests. Most of the building structures are built with granite blocks cut with bronze or stone tools and smoothed with sand. Although none of the blocks are the same size they fit perfectly together. The blocks are compacted so tightly together that you can even fit the thinnest of knife blades between the stones. One uncommon thing about Machu Pichu lies within the stone formations of the city. Many uses came of the stone; from the development of significant structures to the temples that remain hanging on the steep precipices.

                The homes in Machu Pichu were very unique in structure. They entailed trapezoid shaped doors, steep roofs, yet windows were not used as a standard. There were some houses that were 2 stories tall. The second story was hard to reach to there had to be a ladder go get up there

                More than 7,000 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains, Machu Picchu is the most visited tourist destination in Peru. A symbol of the Incan Empire and built around 1450AD, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.

                The Incas who built the ancient city likely called it Huayna Picchu, the report said. Huayna translates to "new or young," while Picchu means "mountain peak" in the Indigenous Quechua language, said Emily Dean, professor of anthropology at Southern Utah University in Cedar City.
