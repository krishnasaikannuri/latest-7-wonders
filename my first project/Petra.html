                Petra is one of the seven wonders of the world, which disappeared for a long time from the world until it was rediscovered to the world, and it became the largest tourist destination in Jordan.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is gaining fame anew every day due to the turnout of many international film directors and their appearance in many clips, which sheds light on it again as it was in its true era, to attract all travel lovers and see other history and civilizations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Petra has an amazing and imaginary building, which made many scientists and experts puzzled for many ages, they could not know what this building is and what the real purpose behind it is in the middle of the desert.
                <br>
                <br>
                Petra was called the lost civilization, and the first discovery of the Jordanian city was in 1812 by the Swiss explorer J. L. Burckhardt. Who was following several legends about a lost city representing a civilization unknown to many, which is a great discovery for him.
                <br>
                <br>
                When this city was discovered and its history was studied, it was discovered that it dates back to the Iron Age, and nearby areas are approximately 15 km away was discovered Neolithic regions which is called Little Petra.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then comes the discovery of the Edomites who lived in the area in Petra at the end of the seventh century and the beginning of the seventh century BC.
                <br>
                <br>
                But because of wars and instability, the Edomites left the city due to the attacks of the Nabataeans, and they knew that they were nomads from the west, and they settled in the city, to benefit from the trade and wealth in the city.
                <br>
                <br>
                After that comes a lot of geometric shapes and famous palaces that show the extent of prosperity in the Nabatean era to form the Petra that we see today.
